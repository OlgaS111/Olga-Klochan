## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Olga Klochan and I am a student at TripleTen becoming a software engineer. :)


In 2024 I quit my career in sales and enrolled in a 10 months Full Stack Developer online Bootcamp at TripleTen. Started in June 2024, during my learning journey I am working on different projects and developing new skills. The TripleTen curriculum provides a wide range of project based on the following full stack development technologies: HTML5, CSS3, VSCode, grid layout, BEM, media queries, transition, Java script, DOM, debugging, GIT/GitHub, Figma and more to come :)



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my first JS project.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my futute travel plans. :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: olgaklochan1@gmail.com
